# Go-Postgres

This project is simple CRUD application built in golang and using PostgreSQL as DB.
This project is explained in this [tutorial].

## Pre-requisite
1. Install golang v1.11 or above.
2. Basic understanding of the golang syntax.
3. Basic understanding of SQL query.
4. Code Editor (I recommend to use VS Code with Go extension by Microsoft installed)
5. Postman for calling APIs

## PostgreSQL Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  userid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INT,
  location TEXT
);
```

## Configuration

Application will look for the configuration file in the same path that the binary is, so make sure to have your config.json file in the same place.

## Logging

Logs are stored in `go-postgres.log` in the same location where the binary is.
